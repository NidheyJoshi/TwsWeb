Important Rules to follow: (You can add or subtract rules)

1. Class names should be self explanatory and not vague. (DO NOT USE SHORT FORMS).
  e.g. Instead of using class = "button" use class = "view-project-button"

2. Please use comments.
  So that we can avoid confusion and delays.
  
3. Please check if your forked repository is up to date with the main branch before merging a pull request.
4. Please give in detail explanation about your commit.
e.g. Made navbar.
  This comment may include the description of reaming work on that specific item
  e.g. remaining work: making it respovsive.
        etc.etc.
        
5. Please only commit in a single file if you have changed only one file. DO NOT update entire repository.
